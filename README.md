# ng-SINFO-webapp

SINFO client web app created using [Angular](https://angular.io)

This was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)

## Prerequisites

Both the CLI and generated project have dependencies that require **Node 6.9.0** or higher, together with **NPM 3** or higher.

You need to install Angular CLI globally

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4201/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
