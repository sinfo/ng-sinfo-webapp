      <h3>The quick version</h3>

      <p>SINFO is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
        age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do
        not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate
        for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference
        participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion of the
        conference organisers.</p>

      <h3>The less quick version</h3>

      <p>We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form and we expect all participants to conduct
        themselves in a professional and appropriate manner. Conference participants violating these rules may be
        sanctioned or expelled from the conference, without a refund, at the discretion of the conference organisers.
        Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender
        identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion,
        sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
        recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
        attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors are
        also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images,
        activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised
        clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.If a participant engages in harassing
        behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or
        expulsion from the conference with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
        harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the SINFO staff immediately. SINFO staff can be
        identified as they'll be wearing branded t-shirts. SINFO staff will be happy to help participants contact venue
        security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel
        safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance. We expect participants to follow these rules
        at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.</p>
